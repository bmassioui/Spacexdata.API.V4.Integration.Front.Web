# React TypeScript Web Frontend

This project is a web frontend built with React and TypeScript, designed to work with the backend application.

## Introduction

This web frontend provides a user interface to interact with the backend application. It allows users to perform various actions, such as retrieving data, submitting forms, and displaying results.

## Getting Started

To get started with the React TypeScript web frontend, follow these steps:

### Requirements

- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- npm (version X.X.X)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository - *main*:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/bmassioui/Spacexdata.API.V4.Integration.Front.Web
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
    cd Spacexdata.API.V4.Integration.Front.Web
    ```

3. Install dependencies::
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App
To run the web frontend locally, use the following command:
```shell
npm start   
```
This will start the development server and open the web app in your default browser. You can access it at http://localhost:3000.

### Building for Production
To build the web frontend for production, use the following command:
```shell
npm run build  
```
This will create an optimized production-ready build in the `build` directory.

### Code Formatting and Linting
1. Prettier
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used for code formatting. You can run the following command to format the codebase:
```shell
npm run format
```

2. ESLint
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is used for code linting. You can run the following command to lint the codebase:
